# TODO
* document the new method, how to speed up to 4 times faster, when the frames were already thrown out, just a speedup to 4 times is needed
* Write changelog retrospectively
* There are a lot of overlap between the sj and gp code. Once I have time, I shall unify them into one tool
* code for gopro was just a quick hack taking the sjcam tools as a starting point, and do some modification, to make it work as an MVP -> Need to update to some quality work
